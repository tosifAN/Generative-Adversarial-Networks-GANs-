# Image Super-Resolution Comparison: SRGAN, ESRGAN, SwinFIR

This project involves testing various state-of-the-art image super-resolution models—SRGAN, ESRGAN, and SwinFIR—on different images and comparing their performance. The source images and their corresponding results are stored in the "Source and Result" directory. Code for each model is organized in separate folders—SRGAN, ESRGAN, and SwinFIR.

## Project Overview

- **SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network):**
  - Implemented SRGAN for image super-resolution using the code available in the "SRGAN" folder.
  - Tested the SRGAN model on various images and saved the results.

- **ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network):**
  - Implemented ESRGAN for image super-resolution using the code available in the "ESRGAN" folder.
  - Conducted testing on different images and stored the resulting images.

- **SwinFIR (Swin Transformer-based Image Restoration):**
  - Utilized SwinFIR for image super-resolution using the code provided in the "SwinFIR" folder.
  - Tested the SwinFIR model on a diverse set of images and saved the outcomes.

## Project Structure

- `SRGAN/`: Contains the code for SRGAN image super-resolution.
- `ESRGAN/`: Holds the code for ESRGAN image super-resolution.
- `SwinFIR/`: Includes the code for SwinFIR-based image restoration.
- `Source and Result/`: Stores source images and their corresponding super-resolved outputs.

## Usage

1. **SRGAN Model:**
   - Access the `SRGAN/` directory for code and usage instructions.
   - Execute the SRGAN code to perform image super-resolution and generate results.

2. **ESRGAN Model:**
   - Navigate to the `ESRGAN/` directory to access the code and usage details.
   - Run the ESRGAN code to conduct image super-resolution and save the output images.

3. **SwinFIR Model:**
   - Visit the `SwinFIR/` directory for SwinFIR model code and usage guidelines.
   - Execute the SwinFIR code for image super-resolution tasks and save the resulting images.
